/* ============================================================================
   Icon sets — an equipped icon set swaps every desktop / taskbar app glyph for
   an alternate style. Each app id is hand-mapped to the closest icon in the
   set; anything unmapped (or iconSet == null) falls back to the app's built-in
   lucide-style glyph.

   v1 sets:
     retro  — 32px pixel PNGs (itch.io "PXL Retro Computer Icons", in
              app/public/shop/icons/retro/items/)
     pixel  — monochrome pixel line SVGs (pixelarticons, MIT)
     solid  — bold filled SVGs (Phosphor Icons "fill" weight, MIT)
